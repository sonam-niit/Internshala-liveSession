SASS ?
------------

we can not do the reusability of our css code.
its very difficult to maintain when you have bigger project.

SASS it is called CSS preprocessor
super set of CSS

we will write a code in SASS then we will comppile it to CSS.

preprocessor: LESS,Stylus

scss: sassy CSS (extention: .scss)
sass: older syntax of sass (ex: .sass)

How to use

create package.json file by executing below command

>npm init -y

create 2 folders named scss and css 
>mkdir scss css
install sass
>npm install sass --save-dev

create file named main.sass in sass folder and this file we will compile and store the converted file in css folder.

for continous conversion write command in package.json file in scripts.
"compile-css": "sass sass/main.sass css/style.css --watch",

(compile sass file and store the compiled one in style.css file)
