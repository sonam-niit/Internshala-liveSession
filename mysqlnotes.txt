MYSQL: structured relational database

we can store our data in the form tables

table consiting rows (records) and columns (field or tuple)
-------------------------------------------------------------

to work with mysql we have 2 options either use mysql community edition or use xampp server (providing mysql inside the same)

Create Table
--------------------

>create table Student(id int primary key, name varchar(20), email varchar(20), password varchar(20))

>insert into student values (1,"alex","alex@gmail.com","alex@123");

>insert into student (id,name,email,password) values (2,"bob","bob@gmail.com","bob@123");

>update student set password="Bob@1675" where id=2

>delete from student where id=1

============================================================================================

Relationships between tables in mysql

one to one 
-- one person can have only one adharcard no
one to many --> many to one
-- one person can enroll for many courses
-- many courses can be enrolled by one person (bi directional)
many to many

-- many customer can order many products

===============================================================
create foreign key

>create table customer(id int primary key,name varchar(20),email varchar(20),phone varchar(10))

> create table order(id int primary key,orderAmount int, custId int,
foreign key(custId) references customer(id))

insert some random records in both tables and now let's fetch the data from this tables.

for the same we can take help of join

we will join the table using PK * FK constraint and we can see the data together.

select c.name, c.email,c.phone, o.orderAmount,o.id
from customer c
inner join orders o
on c.id= o.custId
(this query will fetch only the common data between both the tables)

select c.name, c.email,c.phone, o.orderAmount,o.id
from customer c
left outer join orders o
on c.id= o.custId

(this query will fetch the common data as well as the left side table(customer) data with right sides null values)
